                    My name is Sadulloev Shokhjakhon and I'm currently studying at Seneca Polytechnic.

                    At Seneca Polytechnic, we study a diverse range of courses, but I've developed a particular passion for web development. I find it especially rewarding because you can see practical results immediately and permanently. Building something from scratch and watching it come to life in the browser provides a tangible sense of accomplishment that drives my enthusiasm for this field.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-6">
                    While I'm drawn to web development, I also recognize its challenges. The field requires knowledge of numerous functions, frameworks, and architectural patterns, which can be demanding but equally exciting. To complement my formal education, I actively work on projects through additional educational platforms, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios and expand my skill set beyond the classroom.
